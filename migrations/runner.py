"""
migrations/runner.py — Programmatic Alembic runner for MythosEngine.

Wraps Alembic's Python API so that SQLiteBackend.__init__ can apply any
pending schema migrations on startup without requiring a CLI call.

Concept mapping
---------------
SchemaVersion          → Alembic's ``alembic_version`` table (auto-managed)
@migration(v0, v1)     → Alembic revision files in migrations/versions/
run_migrations(engine) → ``alembic upgrade head`` via the Python API

Fresh-database behaviour
------------------------
If create_all() has already built the tables (no alembic_version row exists),
run_migrations() stamps the database at "head" so that Alembic doesn't try to
re-create tables that are already present.  Subsequent startups apply only
migrations newer than the stamped revision.

# @migration decorator — thin adapter for hand-written migration callables
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This decorator lets you write inline Python migrations alongside the
# Alembic revision files.  It is NOT a replacement for Alembic; it is a
# convenience for very simple, non-DDL data migrations that don't need a
# downgrade path.
#
# Usage example (in a migrations/versions/ file or your own module):
#
#   from migrations.runner import migration
#
#   @migration(from_version="0001", to_version="0002")
#   def backfill_titles(session):
#       for row in session.execute(text("SELECT id, data FROM notes")).fetchall():
#           ...
#
# The decorator registers the function but does NOT run it automatically;
# you call it explicitly when needed.
