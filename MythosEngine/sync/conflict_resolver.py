"""
Sync Conflict Resolution Strategy for MythosEngine.

When the same note is edited in two places (e.g. local edits made offline,
then a sync with a remote or shared vault), a conflict arises. This module
defines the strategies for resolving those conflicts and the data types
needed to represent them.

Wire-in:
  - Import ConflictResolver and ConflictStrategy in the sync manager (not yet
    written) when a two-way sync operation detects diverged versions.
  - Use DEFAULT_CONFLICT_STRATEGY as the per-vault default; allow users to
    override it in vault settings.
  - Catch ConflictNeedsReviewError at the sync boundary and surface the
    ConflictRecord to the UI so the user can pick a winner manually.
